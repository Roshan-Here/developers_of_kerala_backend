## Project Overview

This repository contains the backend services for the OpenSource Kerala Developers Gig/Job Platform, a project dedicated to fostering the growth of the Python community in Kerala. As we embark on this journey, we invite passionate developers to contribute to the core of our open-source job/freelance platform.

## About

The backend repository serves as the foundation of our platform, encompassing API services, data management, and server-side functionalities to support the frontend interface.

## Key Features

- **API Endpoints**: Handle job listings, freelance gigs, user authentication, and community-related functionalities through robust API endpoints.
- **Data Management**: Efficiently manage and store data related to job listings, user profiles, collaborations, and more.
- **Authentication and Security**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data and interactions.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Design for scalability and optimal performance to handle growing user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: Utilizing FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **Database (Choose based on preference)**: Planning to utilize MongoDB Atlas for data storage (Looking for contributor).
- **Authentication**: Implementing authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in FastAPI (Looking for contributor).
- **Deployment**: Deploying on Digital Ocean using Docker (Looking for contributor).

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** the forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv env`.
   - Activate the virtual environment (`source env/bin/activate` for Unix/Linux, `env\Scripts\activate` for Windows).
4. **Install Requirements**: Run `poetry install` to install necessary dependencies.
5. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**: Run `poetry run pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts.
6. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add required secrets and configurations to the `.env` file (secrets are available on Notion for team members).
7. Make your **contributions** or enhancements to API endpoints, data models, security measures, or performance optimizations.
8. Create a **Pull Request**.

We welcome all kinds of contributions, whether it's building the backend, bug fixes, new API endpoints, database optimizations, or documentation improvements. Join us in building a robust backend to support the Kerala Python community!
